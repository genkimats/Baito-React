Problems:

- When workday removed and then changed to add mode, the removed workdays appear again.
  - prob a bug in deleting workdays

TODO:

- set month view and year view
  - create function to calculate monthly salaru

Done:

- initialize SalaryPage
- changing from 2024-12 to 2025-01, value becomes 2026-01
- set onChangeMonth to connect with the yearMonth
- set worktime range
- allow day selection using number (shortcut) only when focus is on the whole page (not focused on time selection)
- fix conditional statement between active element and TextFields
