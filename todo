Problems:

1.  change month using arrow keys does not change the month display -> Partially fixed, issue sometimes occur
2.  isModalOpen does not become true when user selects the worktime box (alleviated when clicking on a different day in calendar)

TODO:

- fix problem 2.

Done:

- support change in wage (add wage prop in workday)
  - add field for wage in add workday
  - default value is the WEEKDAY_WAGE and WEEKEND_WAGE
- create modal for confirmation of add/remove/save
- Settings page
  - adjust generated ui (partially done)
  - implement mechanism to store settings to localStorage
  - limit "pay interval" to values(x) which 60 % x == 0
    - either provide fixed values, or calculate the modulo every time
  - limit the minute choices by incrementing by the "pay interval" value
- localize the states (replace shared states) in ManageWorkdayPage
  - create function to calculate monthly salary
- set month view and year view
- initialize SalaryPage
- changing from 2024-12 to 2025-01, value becomes 2026-01
- set onChangeMonth to connect with the yearMonth
- set worktime range
- allow day selection using number (shortcut) only when focus is on the whole page (not focused on time selection)
- fix conditional statement between active element and TextFields
